# nginx-uwsgi-python
Docker image for using NGINX with uWSGI as HTTP router for a Django Python project via Docker Compose

## Note:
Any Python application that uses this image will need a ```uwsgi.ini``` file in their parent directory (where the Dockerfile is).
### And...
The application must run on port ```:8080```, unless you overwrite the included ```nginx.conf```.

This must contain:

    [uwsgi]
    wsgi-file = /app/main.py

Where ```wsgi = /app/main.py``` is a reference to the Python module (e.g. ```main.py```) containing the WSGI entry point ```application```. 
See [The first WSGI application](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html#the-first-wsgi-application) 
in the uWSGI docs for additional information.
